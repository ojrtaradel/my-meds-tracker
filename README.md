## 📖 Overview

**My Meds Tracker** was designed to solve a specific, real-world problem: managing medication stock for patients with complex refill schedules (30, 60, or 90-day cycles). Unlike standard daily alarm apps, this tracker focuses on **inventory management, cost tracking, and compliance reporting**.

It features a dynamic **Traffic Light Dashboard** that visually indicates urgency:
* 🟢 **Green:** Safe (Stock is sufficient).
* 🟠 **Orange:** Warning (Refill due in < 10 days).
* 🔴 **Red:** Critical (Stock empty or refill overdue).

## 🚀 Live Demo

You can try the application using the built-in **Tester Account**. This mode strictly hides sensitive medical data, masks specific medicine names, and blocks all database write operations to protect privacy during public demonstrations.

* **App Link:** [https://oscar-meds-2026.web.app/]
* **Tester Password:** `tester2026`

> **Note:** The Tester account is strictly **Read-Only**. Saving changes, modifying stock, and generating new history logs are disabled in this mode.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Dual-Login Security Architecture
The app implements a unique dual-layer login system to ensure personal privacy while allowing for public portfolio demonstrations:
* **Admin Mode:** Full access to real personal data, "Edit/Save" capabilities, and live Firestore database writes.
* **Demo/Tester Mode:** Automatically masks sensitive brand names, completely hides chemical ingredients, removes critical medications from the view entirely, and safely disables write operations.

### 📊 Smart Reporting & Export
* **Snapshot Generation:** Generates a high-resolution, receipt-style PNG image of current stock levels for quick sharing.
* **PDF Reports:** Generates formal medication history logs using the `pdf` and `printing` packages.
* **CSV Export:** Exports raw data for spreadsheet analysis.
* **Cross-Platform Sharing:** Uses `share_plus` to trigger the native Share Sheet on iOS/Android, while gracefully falling back to direct file downloads on Web/Desktop.

### 🧠 Intelligent Logic
* **Daily Auto-Deduction:** Automatically calculates and deducts pill counts behind the scenes based on the time elapsed since the last recorded visit.
* **Cycle Management:** Supports flexible refill cycles (30d, 60d, 90d) and recalculates the "Next Planned Visit" dates dynamically.


## 🛠️ Technical Stack

* **Frontend:** Flutter (Web & Mobile responsive)
* **Backend:** Google Firebase (Firestore Database)
* **State Management:** Stateful Widgets & Real-time Streams
* **Key Packages:**
    * `cloud_firestore`: Real-time database syncing.
    * `pdf` & `printing`: Advanced document layout and generation.
    * `share_plus`: Native device sharing capabilities.
    * `intl`: Precise date formatting and localization.
